<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you're interested in checking out our project here are the steps to get started!

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html">Conda</a>
* <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify Developer Account</a>
* <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key">OpenAI API Key</a>


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/syanification/Kora.git
   ```
2. Create a new conda environment with requirements.txt
    ```sh
    conda create --name your_env --file requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create a new file in `src/` called `gptConfit.py` and put your API key inside.
    ```py
    API_KEY="YOUR-KEY"
    ```
4. Create a file `api-config.json` inside of `config/` and put your secret key and cid inside.
    ```json
    {
        "scope": "playlist-modify-private playlist-modify-public user-modify-playback-state",
        "cid": "YOUR-CID",
        "secret": "YOUR-SECRET-KEY",
        "redirectURI": "http://localhost:8888/callback"
    }
    ```
5. Enter your conda environment.
    ```sh
    conda activate your_env
    ```
6. Run `MusicPlayer.py`
    ```sh
    python src/MusicPlayer.py
    ```
7. The first time you use a function you will be prompted to sign into spotify, once you log in you are good to go! Enjoy :\)
